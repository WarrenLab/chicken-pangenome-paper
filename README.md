# chicken-pangenome-paper
Scripts used to perform analyses in Rice et al. (2023)

## Introduction
This repository contains scripts used to perform analyses in the paper
"Paper name". It is divided into the following subdirectories, each with their
own README:

* `genome-assembly`: scripts used to assemble genomes to use to create the
  pangenome
* `pangenome-creation`: scripts used to create both the minigraph-cactus and
  PGGB pangenomes
* `alignment-and-genotyping`: scripts used to align reads to the pangenome and
  genotype based on those alignments
* `simulation`: scripts used to create simulated reads, align them to the
  pangenome with different methods, and compare the accuracy of the different
  alignments
